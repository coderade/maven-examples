# Maven VS Ant

Two examples of the same HelloWorld application with the scripting tool Ant and the build tool Maven.

Check at my [Blog](http://coderade.in) an article that I created showing some differences between the tools Maven and Ant tool in English and Portuguese:

* [Ant VS Maven - English](http://coderade.in/ant-vs-maven)
* [Ant VS Maven - Portuguese](http://br.coderade.in/ant-vs-maven)

### Running the Ant example

To run the Ant example you need to have the [Ant]([Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) tool installed. To help you install this tool, look the file [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md).
