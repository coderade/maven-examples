# Studying [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

This repository was created with purpose to demonstrate examples created in the
study of the Maven tool.

Check at my [Blog](http://coderade.in) an article that I created showing a
little of what I learned about the Maven tool and its differences
compared to Ant tool in English and Portuguese:

* [Ant VS Maven - English](http://coderade.in/ant-vs-maven)

* [Ant VS Maven - Portuguese](http://br.coderade.in/ant-vs-maven)

## Examples
* `maven-vs-ant`: Two examples demonstrating the same application with the Build tool
Maven and the Scripting tool [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/).
Check the file [MAVEN-VS-ANT.md](maven-vs-ant/README.md) for more information.

* `maven-helloworld`: Example of a Hello World application with Maven.
Check the file [MAVEN-HELLOWORLD.md](maven-helloworld/README.md) for more information.

* `maven-with-dependencies`: Example of a Maven application with dependencies.
Check the file [MAVEN-WITH-DEPENDENCIES.md](maven-with-dependencies/README.md)
for more information.

* `maven-with-dep-n-scope`: Example of a Maven application with dependencies and different scopes.
Check the file [MAVEN-WITH-DEP-N-SCOPE.md](maven-with-dep-n-scope/README.md).


## Installing the tools

To run theses examples you need to have Java, Maven and Ant installed.

Check the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file to help install them.
