# Studying [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

This repository was created with purpose to demonstrate examples created in the study of the Maven tool.

Look at my [Blog](http://coderade.in) an article that I created showing a little of what I learned about the Maven tool and its differences compared to Ant tool in English and Portuguese:

* [Ant VS Maven - English](http://coderade.in/ant-vs-maven)

* [Ant VS Maven - Portuguese](http://br.coderade.in/ant-vs-maven)

Examples:
* `mvn-vs-ant`: Two examples demonstrating the same application with the Build tool Maven and the Scripting tool [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). Check the file [MVN-VS-ANT.md](mvn-vs-ant/README.md).

* `mvn-helloworld`: Example of a Hello World application with Maven. Check the file [MVN-HELLOWORLD.md](mvn-helloworld/README.md).

* `mvn-with-dependencies`: Example of a Maven application with dependencies. Check the file [MVN-WITH-DEPENDENCIES.md](mvn-with-dependencies/README.md).

* `mvn-with-dep-n-scope`: Example of a Maven application with dependencies and different scopes. Check the file [MVN-WITH-DEP-N-SCOPE.md](mvn-with-dep-n-scope/README.md).
